Once the graylog setup is complete and you are in the UI (usually on port 9200)
Creating these 2 things is the most important
1. Input
2. Stream
 
Simply go to streams tab and create 1 stream for each application.
Once the stream is created then create a rule for the stream with these values
'Field' = tag
'Type' = matchexactly
'Value' = <the tag which you will give in docker container>

Then go to 'inputs' tab and create the input, there are a lot of options, so choose the one which is suitable.
For the below example, which sends logs over udp using gelf, create a 'GELF UDP' input



Now example if you want to send logs from docker container of your application then send it like this
(make sure that the traffic is allowed from application vm to graylog vm on udp:12201 since we will be using that, you can whitelist more according to your needs)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

services:
  feapp:
    image: feimage
    container_name: fecontainer
    logging:
      driver: gelf
      options:
        gelf-address: "udp://<graylog-server-ip>:12201"  # Replace with your Graylog server IP
        tag: "feapp" # this tag should match with the tag which you created in the stream rule
    ports:
      - "8081:80"

  beapp:
    image: beapp
    container_name: beapp
    logging:
      driver: gelf
      options:
        gelf-address: "udp://<graylog-server-ip>:12201"  # Replace with your Graylog server IP
        tag: "beapp"
    ports:
      - "8082:80"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DONE!!
Now go to streams and enjoy the logs



Bonus Tips:
1. Go to 'Indices' and edit all indices and set Max. days in storage and Min. days in storage , this will help in saving storage.
2. Create users and teams with minimum access like Readonly access and share those creds with your team.
