Event loop 

There is an event queue, and an event loop.
All the requests from the clients are parked in the event queue.
The event loop periodically checks for events in this event queue.

If the request is a non-blocking request (asynchronous request: which doesnot require a thread for processing), then it processes and sends the response to the client.
If the request is a blocking request (synchronous request), then it goes to a thread pool and requests for a worker to process its request, 
if the worker is available, then it is assigned and processed response is sent back to the user.

There are limited number of workers/threads in a thread pool which is equal to total nummber of cpu cores of the server
