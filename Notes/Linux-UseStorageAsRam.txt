A swap file is a file on your storage disk that your operating system can use as additional "virtual" memory when your physical RAM is low. 
It essentially extends your system's memory by temporarily storing less-used data from RAM on disk, freeing up actual RAM for active processes.
Although it is comparitively slow than actual RAM, but still it works

-----Steps to configure it-----

- Create a Swap File
  sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile

- Set Correct Permissions
  sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

- Set Up the Swap Area
  sudo mkswap /swapfile

- Enable the Swap File
  sudo swapon /swapfile

- Verify Swap Space
  swapon --show

- Make Swap Permanent. To ensure the swap persists across reboots, add it to /etc/fstab
  echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
