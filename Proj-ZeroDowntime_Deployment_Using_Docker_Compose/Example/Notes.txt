## Install docker rollout and beaware to add your user or root in the group, else docker wont recognize the rollout commands

## Install certbot for generating ssl certificates

# this creates 1 single certificate with two domains, it will only generate certs, not attach it, so need to load it in the nginx.conf 
sudo certbot certonly --standalone \
  -d fe.mycompany.com \
  -d be.mycompany.com

# this creates seperate certificate for the two domains, it will only generate certs, not attach it, so need to load it in the nginx.conf
sudo certbot certonly --standalone \
  -d fe.mycompany.com

sudo certbot certonly --standalone \
  -d be.mycompany.com

## If healthcheck is not defined in compose then rollout will just wait for container to start, default time 10seconds, so its better to add healthcheck, although its not required

## You cant define ports, container names for your services, and using proxy is necessary
